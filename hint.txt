In angular js Module is a "Main method"
It contain controlle,directive and fileter.
Module is declartively specify how application is worked.
it can be specified by angular.module("nameof module",[])
module declartion have 2 parameters 
1st parameter is name of the module , 
2nd parameter is dependent module
which means one module is dependent to the other externel module.
if 2nd parameter is empty array it does not have a dependent to a other external module

ng-model is directive.This Directive canbe used only a some specific html element
These are "input", "textarea","select"

ng-model does not have a {{}}
